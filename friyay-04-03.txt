1. Fizz Buzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 'n'. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'



2. Write a function that multiples two numbers (provided as arguments) without using *



3. Write a function to reverse a string (provided as an argument)



4. Write a function called sumZero which accepts a SORTED array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
eg [-11, -8, -3, 1, 2, 5, 8, 23] => [-8, 8]

4b. Find the first pair where the sum is 0 given an UNSORTED array. Solve O(n). No nested loops. Find a solution without first sorting the array.
eg  [-2, -3, 1, 8, 14, -6, 7, 3] => [3, 3];



5. Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of 1s)
eg [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1] => 7



6. Write a function to return a boolean based on whether or not the argument provided (string) is a palindrome. A palindrome is word or phrase that has the same characters whether forward or backwards
eg racecar => true; truck => false
